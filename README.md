# :camera: Instagram Hashtag Printer
<br>

- This is a software that allows you to search for all latest public Instagram images that has a particular hashtag.

- From there onwards, you can just view them or print them directly to your default printer.

* You'll need Qt 5.7 libraries to compile and run

* Check out the demo screenshots below!

* *I deleted old commits with force push

##### :+1: This repo is recently updated as the link to retrieve the images has changed as Instagram started using GraphQL.
